            Meat and poultry is composed of muscle, connective tissue, fat and bone. The muscle is approximately 75%
            water (although different cuts may have more or less water) and 20% protein with the remaining 5%
            representing a combination of fat, carbohydrate and minerals. Chicken meat is one of the most recommended by
            experts to incorporate high quality proteins and nutrients into our diet. In addition, it has a low-fat
            content which makes it ideal for any type of diet. Australorp, Barnvelder, Bielefelder, Black/red Star,

            Meat is composed of water, protein and amino acids, minerals, fats and fatty acids, vitamins and other
            bioactive components, and small quantities of carbohydrates. Meat ranks among one of the most significant,
            nutritious and favored food item available to masses, which aids in fulfilling most of their body
            requirements. It has played a vital role in human evolution and is an imperative constituent of a
            well-balanced diet. It is a good source of proteins, zinc, iron, selenium, and phosphorus followed by
            vitamin A and B-complex vitamins. Average value of meat protein is about 23% that varies from higher to
            lower value according to the type of meat source.

            <h2>Sushi</h2>
          </div>
          <section>
            Traditionally, the vinegared rice is lightly seasoned with salt and sugar. Popular proteins are fish cakes,
            imitation crab meat, egg, tuna, or shrimp. Nigiri: A topping, usually fish, served on top of sushi rice. Not
            all nigiri is raw, though this dish is best for people who want to appreciate the flavor of the fish,
            shellfish, or other toppings. Sashimi: Fish or shellfish served alone (no rice). This is best for people who
            really love to taste the fish or shellfish since it comes with nothing else. Maki: Rice and filling wrapped
            in seaweed. This is what most people think of when they think of sushi rolls. Uramaki: Similar to the above,
            but rice is on the outside and seaweed wraps around the filling. These rolls often have lots of toppings and
            sauces â€” they may either be cooked or raw. Temaki: Sushi that has been hand-rolled into a cone shape.
